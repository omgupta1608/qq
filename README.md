# qq

A simple and minimal command-line todo manager written in Rust.

---

##  Introduction

`qq` is a CLI-based personal todo tracker that helps you manage daily tasks with a focus on simplicity. It stores your tasks in a local config file, organized by date, and supports basic operations like adding, completing, and reviewing your daily and spillover tasks.

---

##  Description

- Tasks are stored by date (local time) (e.g., `19 April 2025`) in a config file using the [`confy`](https://crates.io/crates/confy) crate.
- Tasks can be added with content, marked as done, and listed.
- "Spillover tasks" are tasks from previous days that were not marked as done.
- All tasks are persisted automatically â€” no manual saving needed.
